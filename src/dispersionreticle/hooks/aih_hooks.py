    # TODO fix it in a more sophisticated way than "this"
    #
    # in Onslaught game mode something weird happens to server gun markers
    # when selecting different than initial vehicle before countdown finishes
    #
    # by this code, we will invalidate BigWorld internal state to reboot GunMarkerComponent
    # as soon as the game starts
    #
    # generally I want to analyze server marker state more precisely with DebugStateCollector
    # however, when I got some free time, Onslaught event has already finished
    # so I cannot find real root cause now
    #
    # previously I've fixed it with blind guess quickly restarting showServerMarker flag and it worked
    # but rebooting is not the finest way to workaround bugs
    #
    # not only that, but after first version of this fix was implemented, it fixed
    # upper mentioned DETERMINISTIC bug in Onslaught
    # HOWEVER, new NON-DETERMINISTIC bug has appeared when certain conditions were met in ANY MATCH:
    # - user was using enabled "Use server aim" from in-game menu
    # - user were not using any server-related reticles from this mod config
    #
    # this bug happens quite rarely and randomly (around 5%-10% chance to appear), but often enough to bother users
    # after roughly 30 matches (I have bad luck as you see) I've managed to reproduce it
    # and introspect all server reticle related variables when it occurred
    # everything was fine with all of them
    # most importantly, Avatar#enableServerAim was eventually called with True when it needed to be True
    #
    # my guess is that
    # changing "server_marker" developer feature flag too fast may cause
    # some consecutive calls to be completely ignored, in result, we may end up with DISABLED server aim
    # despite calling it with True
    #
    # in other words, it looks like setting developer feature flags on Avatar base
    # may be NON-BLOCKING ASYNCHRONOUS operation (or something really is messed up that I haven't noticed yet)
    #
    # or it might be related to __onArenaStarted being called by BigWorld
    # and bug is some race condition that messes up "server_marker" flag
    #
    # either way, to workaround this, we will delay calls a little bit to be (most likely) sure BigWorld caught up
    # to accept consecutive call (probably 1 ms would be fine, but let's throw 40 ms to be sure, why the heck not)
    #
    # this is overall bad, but for now it is what it is
